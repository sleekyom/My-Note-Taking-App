Assignment:

Please write a small note-taking application that has 2 screens:

1) MainActivity with a RecyclerView that displays recorded notes (Title, message, date). It can also have a button to record a new note

2)NoteEditActivity that lets the user create new or edit an existing note. It should have two input fields: Title and Message

The notes should be recorded in the local SQLite database.
